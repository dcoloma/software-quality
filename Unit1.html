<P>These are the notes for Sofware Quality at USJ

<P>Early Draft 
</P>
<H1>Introduction to Software Quality 
</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Why Software Quality matters</H2>
<P>Let's have a look at one of the most famous bugs of the whole
Software History, the bug that AT&amp;T suffered in 1990. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">An example of the onsequences of Poor Quality
Software</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">What happened?</H4>
<P>At 2:25pm on Monday, January 15th, network managers at AT&amp;T's
Network Operations Center began noticing an alarming number of red
warning signals coming from various parts of their network. Within
seconds, the network warnings were rapidly spreading from one
computer-operated switching center to another. The managers tried to
bring the network back up to speed for nine hours, while engineers
raced to stabilize the network, almost 50% of the calls placed
through AT&amp;T failed to go through until at 11:30pm, when network
laods were low enough to allow the system to stabilize. 
</P>
<P>AT&amp;T alone lost more than $60 million in unconnected calls. Of
course, there were many additional consequences difficult to be
measured such as business taht could be done because relied on
network connectivity. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The system was failure tolerant, wasn't it?</H4>
<P>AT&amp;T's long-distance network was a model of reliability and
strength. On any given day, AT&amp;T's long-distance service, which
at 1990 carried over 70% of the US long-distance traffic. 
</P>
<P>The backbone of this massive network was a system of 114
computer-operated electronic switches (4ESS) distributed across the
United States. These switches, each capable of handling up to 700,000
calls an hour, were linked via a cascading network known as Common
Channel Signaling System No. 7 (SS7). When a telephone call was
received by the network from a local exchange, the switch would asses
14 different possible routes to complete the call. At the same time,
it passed the telephone number to a parallel signalling network that
checked the alternate routes to determine if the switch at the other
end could deliver the call to it's local company. If the destination
switch was busy, the original switch sent the caller a busy signal
and released the line. If the switch was available, a signal-network
computer made a reservation at the destination switch and ordered the
destination switch to pass the call, after the switches checked to
see if the connection was good. The entire process took only four to
six seconds. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">What went wrong?</H4>
<P>The day the bug popped-up, a team of 100 frantically searching
telephone technicians identified the problem, which began in New York
City. The New York switch had performed a routine self-test that
indicated it was nearing its load limits. As standard procedure, the
switch performed a four-second maintenance reset and sent a message
over the signalling network that it would take no more calls until
further notice. After reset, the New York switch began to distribute
the signals that had backed up during the time it was off-line.
Across the country, another switch received a message that ea call
from New York was on it's way, and began to update it's records to
show the New York switch back on line. A second message from the New
York switch then arrived, lass than ten milliseconds after the first.
Because the first message had not yet been handled, the second
message should have been saved until later. A software defect then
caused the second message to be written over crucial communications
information. Software in the receiving switch detected the overwrite
and immediately activated a backup link while it reset itself, but
another pair of closely timed messages triggered the same response in
the backup processor, causing it to shut down also. When the second
switch recovered, it began to route it's backlogged calls, and
propagated the cycle of close-timed messages and shut-downs
throughout the network. The problem repeated iteratively throughout
the 114 switches in the network, blocking over 50 million calls in
the nine hours it took to stabilize the system. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">The roots of the issue</H4>
<P>The cause of the problem had come months before. In early
December, technicians had upgraded the software to speed processing
of certain types of messages. Although the upgraded code had been
rigorously tested, a one-line bug was inadvertantly added to the
recovery software of each of the 114 switches in the network. The
defect was a C program that featured a break statement located within
an if clause, that was nested within a switch clause. In pseudocode,
the program read as follows: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">1  while (ring receive buffer not empty and side buffer not empty) DO
2    Initialize pointer to first message in side buffer
     or ring receive buffer

3    get copy of buffer

4    switch (message)
5       case (incoming_message):
6             if (sending switch is out of service) DO
7                 if (ring write buffer is empty) DO
8                     send &quot;in service&quot; to status map
9                 else
10                    break
                  END IF
11            process incoming message, set up pointers to
              optional parameters

12            break
       END SWITCH

13   do optional parameter work
          </PRE><P>
When the destination switch received the second of the two closely
timed messages while it was still busy with the first (buffer not
empty, line 7), the program should have dropped out of the if clause
(line 7), processed the incoming message, and set up the pointers to
the database (line 11). Instead, because of the break statement in
the else clause (line 10), the program dropped out of the case
statement entirely and began doing optional parameter work which
overwrote the data (line 13). Error correction software detected the
overwrite and shut the switch down while it couls reset. Because
every switch contained the same software, the resets cascaded down
the network, incapacitating the system. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Lessons Learned</H4>
<P>Unfortunately, it is not difficult for a simple software error to
remain undetected, to later bring down even the most reliable
systems. The software update loaded in the 4ESSs had already passed
through layers of testing adn had remained unnoticed through the busy
Christmas season. AT&amp;T was fanatical about it's reliability. The
entire network was designed such that no single switch could bring
down the system. The software contained self-healing features that
isolated defective switches. The network used a system of &quot;paranoid
democracy,&quot; where switches and other modules constantly
monitored each other to determine if they were &quot;sane&quot; or
&quot;crazy.&quot; Sadly, the Jan. 1990 incident showed the
possibility for all of the modules to go &quot;crazy&quot; at once,
how bugs in self-healing software can bring down healthy systems, and
the difficulty of detecting obscure load- and time-dependent defects
in software. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Software Crisis</H3>
<P>But we could think that this bug occured a while ago and that
nowadays we have more advanced technologies, methodologies, training
systems and developers. 
</P>
<P>Is this really true? Just partially, it's true Software
Development has evolved a lot, but the type of problems that are
solved via Software has also evolved, every day with try to solve
more problems and more complex via software. 
</P>
<P>The &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Software Crisis&acirc;&euro;<FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN"><FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN">&#65437;
</SPAN></FONT></SPAN></FONT>term was coined by USA Department of
Defence years ago in order to describe that the complexity of the
problems addressed of software has outpaced the improvements in the
software creation process . 
</P>
<P>&quot;Few fields have so large a gap between best current practice
and average current practice.&quot;

The Software Complexity Evolution 
</P>
<P>In other words, the software creation process has evolved very
little while the problems software is solving are way too much
complex 
</P>
<P>&quot;We have repeatedly reported on cost rising by millions of
dollars, schedule delays, of not months but years, and
multi-billion-dollar systems that don't perform as envisioned. The
understanding of software as a product and of software development as
a process is not keeping pace with the growing complexity and
software dependence of existing and emerging mission-critical
systems.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Government Accounting Office 
</P>
<P>Additionally, as depicted in , the need of software developers has
increased exponentially, because more software is needed as software
is used in nearly every product with a minimum of complexity. Whereas
the need of developers has increased exponentially, the availability
of developers has unfortunately not growed at the same pace, i.e.
there are less developers than what is needed. Due to that, people
without the right skills have started developing software, with the
believe that developing software is an easy task that nearly
everybody could do. Developing software with people not properly
trained or without the right skills inherently leads to bad quality
software.

<H3 CLASS="western">Legal Warranties</H3>
<P>Mortenson, a construction contractor purchased software from
Timberline Software Corporation, which Timberline installed in
Mortenson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s computers. Mortenson, relying on the
software, placed a bid which was $1.95 million too low because a bug
in the software of which Timberline was aware. The State of
Washington Supreme Court ruled in favor of Timberline Software.
However, a simple bug in the software lead to multiple problems to
both companies. In the US Warranty Laws, the Article 2 of the Uniform
Commercial Code includes the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Uniform Computer
Information Transaction Act&acirc;&euro;<FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN"><FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN">&#65437;

<UL>
	<LI><P>Disclaim all liability for defects

	<LI><P>Prevent the transfer of software from person to person
	remotely 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Disable licensed software during a dispute 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>That act, practically means that software distributors can limit
their liability through appropriate clauses in the contracts. For
instance, below is shown the disclaimer of warranties of a Microsoft
product. Although the law overprotects software developers and
distributors, using these disclaimers may prevent legal problems, but
there are multiple additional problems related with poor software
that are not avoided by them.

<P>Although the law overprotects software developers and

it is just a way to avoid the legal problems of having bad quality

frustrates end users.. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What is Software Quality?</H2>
<P>Many people have tried to define what does Software Quality mean.
However, it is not an easy task. Quality in general (not only in
Software) is such a subjective topic that trying to define it
formally is extremelly challenging. 
</P>
<P>There is a very interesting book called &quot;Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; <B>link</B> in which the narrator talks
about the proces of creative writing, and specially about quality.
The quality of a written text is difficult to define. If you ask
people to rank essays (or programs) from best to worst it is very
likely they reach a consensus &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; they have an
intuitive understanding that one essay has more quality than another
&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s much more difficult
to identify the parts of the essay that give it quality. 
</P>
<P>In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Pirsig (the author)
explores the meaning and concept of quality, a term he deems to be
undefinable. Pirsig's thesis is that to truly experience quality one
must both embrace and apply it as best fits the requirements of the
situation. According to Pirsig, such an approach would avoid a great
deal of frustration and dissatisfaction common to modern life. 
</P>
<P>Let's think about another example of how the situation determines
the quality. For instance, a master chef has prepared an exquisite
meal and invited a group of friends to share it at her restaurant on
a lovely summer evening. Unfortunately the air conditioning isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
working at the restaurant, the waiters are surly, and two of the
friends have had a nasty argument on the way to the restaurant that
dominates the dinner conversation. The meal itself is of the highest
quality but the experiences of the diners are not. 
</P>
<P>You could think that writing code is very different to writing an
essay, but that is not the case. Usually, when you have a look at a
piece of code it is easy for you to determine if you like it or not,
but it becomes quite complicated to assess why. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">View 1: Formal Definition</H3>
<P>Software quality may be defined as conformance to explicitly
stated functional and performance requirements, explicitly documented
development standards and implicit characteristics that are expected
of all professionally developed software. 
</P>
<P>This definition emphasis from three points: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Software requirements are the foundations from which quality
	is measured: Lack of conformance to requirement is lack of quality. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Specified standards define a set of development criteria that
	guide the manager is software engineering: If criteria are not
	followed lack of quality will almost result. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>A set of implicit requirements often goes unmentioned, like
	for example ease of use, maintainability, etc.: If software confirms
	to its explicit requirement but fails to meet implicit
	requirements,software quality is suspected. 
	</P>
	<OL>
		<P>For the first item, explicit software requirements, it is going
		to be relatively easy to check objectively the conformance to them,
		for the second one, it is going to be more complicated and depends
		on how documented those standards are, for the implicit
		characteristics expected, it is going to be even tougher, as
		measuring conformace to something that is implicit, is, by
		definition, impossible. 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<H3 CLASS="western">View 2: The Human Point of View</H3>
		</UL>
		<P>Those &quot;implicit&quot; requirements mentioned in the formal
		definition are a hint to indicate that there is something more
		about Software that goes beyond the explicit requirements. At the
		end of the day, software is going to be used by people, which do
		not care about the requirements but about their expectations.
		Hence, the need to look for another point of view. 
		</P>
		<P>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;A product's quality is a function of how
		much it changes the world for the better.&quot;
		[[MANAGEMENT-VS-QUALITY]] or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Quality is value
		to some person&quot; [[QUALITY-SOFTWARE-MANAGEMENT]]. Both
		definitions stress that the quality may be subjective. I.e.
		different people are going to perceive different quality in the
		same software. The software developers should also think about end
		users and asking themselves questions such as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;How
		are users going to use the software?&acirc;&euro;<FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN"><FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN">&#65437;</SPAN></FONT></SPAN></FONT>.
				</P>
		<P>In order to provide a more complete picture, IEEE standard
		610.12-1990 combines both views in their definitions of quality: 
		</P>
		<P>Software quality is</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>The degree to which a system, component, or process meets
			specified requirements. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>The degree to which a system, component or process meets
			customer or user needs or expectations. 
			</P>
			<H3 CLASS="western">View 3: Internal vs. External Quality</H3>
		</UL>
		<P>There is another dimension of Software Quality that depends on
		whether we focused on the part of the Software that is exposed to
		the users or on the part of the Software that is not. 
		</P>
		<P>External Quality is the fitness for purpose of the software,
		i.e. does the software what it is supposed to do?. The typical way
		to measure external quality is through functional tests and bugs
		measurement. 
		</P>
		<P>Usually this is related to the conformance requirements that
		affect end-users (formal definition) as well as to meeting the
		end-user expectations (human point of view). 
		</P>
		<P>Some of the properties that determine the external quality of
		software are: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Conformance to the product specifications and user
			expectations. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Reliability: Is the software working with the same level
			performance under different conditions and during all the time. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Accuracy: Does the software do exactly what is supposed to
			do. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Ease of use and comfort: Is the software easy to use and
			responds in an amount time according to user expectations? 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Robustness: Does the software adapt to unforeseen
			situations, e.g. invalid input parameters, connectivity lost... 
			</P>
		</UL>
		<P>Internal Quality is everything the software does but is never
		seen directly by the end-user. It's the implementation, which the
		customer never directly sees. Internal quality can be measured by
		conformance requirements (not focused on end-users but on software
		structure), software analysis and adherence to development
		standards or best practices. 
		</P>
		<P>If it is not visible to end-user, and our target is make
		customers happy, we could ask ourselves if Internal Quality is
		something we should pay attention to. 
		</P>
		<P>Internal quality is related with the design of the software and
		it is purely in the interest of development. If Internal quality
		starts falling, the system will be less amenable to change in the
		future. Due to that, code reviews, refactoring and testing are
		essential as otherwise the internal quality will slip. 
		</P>
		<P>An interesting analogy with debts and bad code design was
		developed Ward [[DEBT-ANALOGY]]. Sometimes companies need to get
		some credit from the banks in order to be able to invest, however,
		it is also critical to understand that is impossible to ask for
		credit continuously as the paying interest will kill the company
		financially. The same could be used for software, sometimes it is
		good to assume some technical debt to achieve a goal, for instance,
		meeting a critical milestone to reach users before our competitors,
		but it is important to understand that assuming technical debt
		endlessly would kill the project as it will make the product
		unmaintainable. 
		</P>
		<P>Sometimes, after achieving the target External Quality, we need
		to refactor our code to improve the Internal Quality. Software
		Quality is sometimes the art of a continuous refactor. 
		</P>
		<P>Let's go back to the analogy of writing an essay or a paper, in
		that case most people write out the first draft as a long
		brain-dump saying everything that should be said. After that, the
		draft is constantly changed (refactored) until it is a cohesive
		piece of work. 
		</P>
		<P>When developing software (for instance in Univeristy assignments
		:-D) the first draft is often finished when it meets the general
		requirements of the task. So, after that, there is an immediate
		need to refactor the work into a better state without breaking the
		external quality. Maybe writing software is also kind of an art? 
		</P>
		<P>This is universally true, and the danger of not paying attention
		to refactor your code is bigger on a larger project where poor
		quality code can lose you days in debugging and refactoring. 
		</P>
		<P>Some of the properties that enable the process of product with
		good internal quality are: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Concision: The code does not suffer from duplication. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Cohesion: Each [module|class|routine] serves a particular
			purpose (e.g. it does one thing) and does it well. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Low coupling: Minimal inter-dependencies and interrelation
			between objects and modules. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Simplicity: The software is always designed in the simplest
			possible manner so that errors are less likely to be introduced. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Generality: Specific solutions are only used if they are
			really needed. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Clarity: the code enjoys a good autodocumentation level so
			that it is easy to be maintained. 
			</P>
		</UL>
		<P>The external quality is sometimes compared with &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Doing

		quality is. 
		</P>
		<P>Usually, the problems with the external quality characteristics
		(correctness, reliability...) are simply visible symptons about
		software problems, that usually are related with internal quality
		attributes: program structure, complexity, coupling, testability,
		reusability, readability, maintainability... Sometimes, when the
		internal quality is bad, external quality can be met during a short

		</UL>
		<P>There is no a single definition of quality. However, the

		</P>
		<H2 CLASS="western">Key Definitions 
		</H2>
		<P>Despite the availability of different quality definitions,

		quality is usually linked to products with low number of defects.
		Therefore, it is assumed that a quality problem is due to the
		impact of a defect. 
		</P>
		<P>But in order to identify which is high quality, defining what a
		defect is needed. In general, there are three concepts used in
		software quality to refer to defects: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Failure: Any deviation of the observed behavior from the
			specified behavior. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Error: System state where any further processing by the
			system will lead to a failure. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Fault: Algorithmic cause of an error. (Also known as bug or
			defect). 
			</P>

		<PRE CLASS="western">Peter is driving his car towards Oxford. While he is driving, the road 
diverts into two different directions:
      1.  Left road to Oxford
      2.  Right road to Cambridge

By mistake, Peter takes the road to Cambridge. That is a fault that is 
committed by Peter.

Suddenly, Peter is in an error situation or state: Peter is heading 
Cambridge and not Oxford.

If Peter goes on and arrives to Cambridge, that would be a failure: 
Peter was planning to get to Oxford but he has arrived to Cambridge instead.

If Peter realizes of the error situation while he is driving Cambridge, 
returns to the junction and takes the right road to Oxford no failure 
would happen as Peter recovers from the error condition.

		<H2 CLASS="western">Software Quality Assurance</H2>
		<UL>
			<H3 CLASS="western">Introduction to SQA</H3>
		</UL>
		<P>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is the set of methods used to
		improve internal and external qualities. SQA aims at preventing,
		identifying and removing defects throughout the development cycle
		as early as possible, as such reducing test and maintenance costs. 
		</P>
		<P>SQA consists of a systematic, planned set of actions necessary
		to provide adequate confidence that the software development
		process or the maintenance process of a software system product
		conforms to established functional technical requirements as well
		as with the managerial requirements of keeping the schedule and
		operating within the budgetary confines. 
		</P>
		<P>The ultimate target of the SQA activities is that few, if any,
		defects remain in the software system when it is delivered to its
		customers or released to the market. As it is virtually impossible
		to remove all defects, another aim of QA is to minimize the
		disruptions and damages caused by these remaining defects. 
		</P>
		<P>The SQA methodology will also depend on the software development
		methodology used, as they are inherently couple. For instance,
		different software development models will focus the test effort at
		different points in the development process. Newer development
		models, such as Agile, often employ test driven development and
		place an increased portion of the testing in the hands of the
		developer, before it reaches a formal team of testers. In a more
		traditional model, most of the test execution occurs after the
		requirements have been defined and the coding process has been
		completed. 
		</P>
		<P>An example of an SQA methodology is available at
		[[IEEE-QA-TEMPLATE]]. 
		</P>
		<P>SQA activities are not only carried out by the Software Quality
		group, the software engineer group is responsible for putting in
		place the SQA methodology defined, which may include different
		activities such as testing, inspection, reviews...

		<UL>
			<LI><P>Defect Prevention: Defect prevention consists on preventing
			certain types of faults from being injected into the software. As
			explained in section 1.1.3, a fault is the missing or incorrect
			human actions that lead to error situations in the software. There
			are two generic ways to prevent defects: 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P>Eliminating certain fault sources such as ambiguities or

				<LI><P>Fault prevention or blocking: Breaking the causal relation
				between error sources and faults through the use of certain tools
				and technologies. 
				</P>
			</UL>
			<LI><P>Defect reduction: Consists in removing the faults from the
			software through fault detection and removal. These QA
			alternatives detect and remove certain faults once they have been
			injected into the software systems. The most traditional QA
			activities fall into this category such as: 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P>Inspection: directly detects and removes faults from the
				software code, design, etc. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>Testing: removes faults based on related failure
				observations during program execution.

			</UL>
			<LI><P>Defect containment: Consists in minimizing the impact of
			the software faults. The most important techniques in this area
			are: 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P>Fault-tolerance techniques: Try to break the causal
				relationship between faults and failures. E.g. ensuring that
				error conditions do not lead to a software failure. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>Containment measures: Once the error has occurred, if
				there is no way to prevent the failure, ideally, it should be
				possible to perform some actions to minimize the impact and

		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>If human misconceptions: Lack of education.

		source elimination should focus on the following areas: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Product and domain specific knowledge.

				</UL>

		and to verify the absence of related faults. Formal development
		methods, or formal methods in short, include formal specification
		and formal verification. 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Formal specification is concerned with producing an
			unambiguous set of product specifications. An unclear
			specification implies that the software target and behaviour may
			depend on the interpretation of the developer, due to that the
			likelyhood of defects in errors is higher. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Formal verification checks the conformance of software
			design or code against these formal specifications, thus ensuring
			that the software is fault-free with respect to its formal
			specifications. 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<H4 CLASS="western">Fault Removal</H4>
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<P>Even if the best software developers in the world are involved
		in a software project, and even if they follow the formal methods
		described in the previous section, some faults will be injected in
		the software code. Due to that, defect prevention needs to be
		complemented with other techniques focused on removing as many of
		the injected faults as possible under project constraints. 
		</P>
		<P>Fault distribution is highly uneven for most software products,
		regardless of their size. Much empirical evidence has accumulated
		over the years to support the so-called 80:20 rule, which states
		that 20% of the software components are responsible for 80% of the
		problems (Pareto Law). There is a great need for risk
		identification techniques to detect the areas in which the fault
		removal activities should be focused. 
		</P>
		<P>There are two key activities that deal with fault removal: Code
		Inspection and Testing. 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<UL>
					<H5 CLASS="western">Inspections</H5>
				</UL>
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<P>The software inspections were first introduced by Michael E.
		Fagan in 1970s, when he was a software development manager at IBM.
		The inspections are a means of verifying intellectual products by
		manually examining the developing product, a piece at a time, by
		small groups of peers to ensure that it is correct and conforms to
		product specifications and requirements. Inspections may be done in
		the software code itself and also in other related items such as
		design or requirements documents. 
		</P>
		<P>Code inspections should check for technical accuracy and
		completeness of the code, verify that it implements the planned
		design, and ensure good coding practices &acirc;&euro;&uml;and
		standards are used. Code inspections should be done after the code
		has been compiled and all syntax errors removed, but before it has
		been unit tested. 
		</P>
		<P>There are different kind of inspections depending on factors
		such as the formality (formal vs informal) the size of the team
		(peer review, team review), whether it is guided or not&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
		The type of inspection to be done depends on the software to be
		reviewed, the team involved and the target of the review. 
		</P>
		<P>Regardless of the inspection type used, there are clear benefits
		when inspections are used. For instance, according th Bell-Northen
		Researh, the cost of detecting a defect is much lower in case of
		inspections (1 hour per defect) than in the case of testing (2-4
		hours per defect).

				</UL>
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<P>Testing is the execution of software and the observation of the
		program behaviour and outcome. As in the case of the software
		inspections, there are different kind of testing, usually applied
		in different phases of the software development process. 
		</P>
		<P>Some of the most typical testing types are: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Unit Testing: individual units of source code are tested to
			determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable
			part of an application. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Module Testing: A complete module is tested to determine if
			it fulfils its requirements. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Integration Testing: Any type of software testing that
			seeks to verify the interfaces between modules against a software
			design. 
			</P>
			<LI><P>System Testing: It tests a completely integrated system to
			verify that it meets its requirements 
			</P>
			<LI><P>Acceptance Testing: Testing performed often in production
			or pre-production environment to check that the software is ready
			for being delivered and deployed. 
			</P>
		</UL>
		<P>A concept tight related with testing (although applicable in
		other areas such as reviews) is the handling of the defects. In
		particular it is very important that the defects detected are
		properly recorded (defect logging) with all the relevant
		information as in many situations finding the error related with a
		fault is not trivial. It is also very important that the issues
		detected are monitored so that everybody knows what is the status
		of every defect after the initial discovery (defect tracking).

				<LI><P>Hazard control through reducing exposure, isolation and

			usually called Pre-QA or Quality Planning Activities. 
			</P>
			<P>The first activity that should be done in SQE is defining what
			are the specific quality goals for the software to be delivered.
			In order to do so, it is important to understand what are the
			expectations of the software end-user/customer. Obviously, it is
			also key to recognize that the budget is limited and that the
			quality target should be financially doable. The following
			activities are key to identify the target quality of the software:
						</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P>Identify quality views and attributes meaningful to target
				customers and users. Which aspects will be key for them to
				perceive the software as high quality one? This may depend a lot
				on the type of product and on the target customers. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>Select direct quality measures that can be used to measure
				those quality attributes that are key for the customers.

				<LI><P>Which QA activities are the most adequate ones to meet the
				customer quality expectations. For doing this, it is important to
				translate the quality views, attributes and goals into the QA
				activities to be performed. It is also very important to
				determine when every QA activity is going to be executed as part
				of the full Software Development Process. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>The external quality measures should be mapped into
				internal indirect ones via selected quality models. Good models
				are required in order to predict external quality based on
				internal indicators. It is also very important to identify how
				the results of this measure are going to be collected and used
				(e.g. what happens if the quality is not good enough or how the

			<P>W. Edwards Deming in the 1950's proposed that business

			requirements. He recommended that business processes be placed in
			a continuous feedback loop so that managers can identify and
			change the parts of the process that need improvements. As a
			teacher, Deming created a (rather oversimplified) diagram to
			illustrate this continuous process, commonly known as the PDCA
			cycle for Plan, Do, Check, Act: 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P>Plan Quadrant: one defines the objectives and determines
				the conditions and methods required to achieve them. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>Do Quadrant: the conditions are created and the necessary
				training to execute the plan is performed (new procedures). The
				work is then performed according to these procedures. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>Check Quadrant: One must check to determine whether work
				is progressing according to the plan and whether the expected
				results are obtained. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>Action Quadrant: If the checkup reveals that the work is
				not being performed according to plan or results are not what was
				anticipated, measures must be devised for appropriate action.

			<P>Another important aspect to be considered is that some of the
			QA activities cannot be done until it is already too late. For
			example, for safey critical systems, post-accident measurements
			provide a direct measure of safety, but due to the damage linked
			to those accidents, they should be avoided by all means. In order
			to take early measures, appropriate models that link some of the
			quality measures during the development process with the end
			product quality are needed. Last but not least, it should be
			stressed that there is an increasing cost of fixing problems late
			instead of doing early, because a hidden problem may lead to other
			related problems, and the longer it stays in the system, the
			discovery is more difficult.

		</UL>
		<H2 CLASS="western">The cost of quality</H2>
		<UL>
			<P>In section 1.1, some of the implications of bad quality
			software have been introduced. The cost of poor quality (COPQ) is
			not the only cost that Sofware Quality Engineering should take
			into account. The cost of having good quality (COGQ) that may be
			linked to SQA activities (e.g testing or code inspections) should
			not be understimated and considered whent the total quality cost
			is assessed. 
			</P>
			<P>As in the case of the external and internal quality, the
			different costs linked to quality have been represented by some
			authors as an iceberg, in which some of the costs are easy to be
			identified (e.g. testing costs, customer returns...) while some
			others are not always taken account (e.g. unused capacity,
			excessive IT costs...). In [[COST-OF-QUALITY]] there is a detailed
			analysis of this approach for identifying quality costs.
